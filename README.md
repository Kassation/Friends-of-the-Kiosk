# Friends-of-the-Kiosk
Here's a minimum viable plan I think we could probably aim for now. It's based on the UserProfileMt we currently have. We could write NFs and HTN plans to get this work. Then we can have add-ons later. Please update any ideas/work you got.


KIOSK start.


KIOSK: Hello, who is this?

USER: [name]

KIOSK (if name not in KB): What is your major?

USER: Computer Science.

KIOSK: What aspects are you interested in CS?

USER: Artificial Intelligence.

KIOSK: What food do you like?

USER: [food]

KIOSK: What drink do you like?

USER: [drink]

KIOSK: I would like to recommend [SpecializedKnowledge-Topic]/[SpecifiedFoodDishType]/[Beverages-IndustrySP] to you.

USER: OK.

USER:Exit.


KIOSK end.
